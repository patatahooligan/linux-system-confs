# Many steam games expect to have a "primary" display. This concept does
# not natively exist on wayland, and sway does not seem to have a way to
# set it. We can run the 'xrandr' command in sway's config but this
# comes with its own set of problems, such as race conditions during
# initialization and apparently it even resets at some points with no
# clear indication as to why. Maybe if all X apps close xwayland stops
# and loses its configuration? In any case, running this before steam
# launches seems to be the safest bet.
xrandr --output DP-1 --primary
